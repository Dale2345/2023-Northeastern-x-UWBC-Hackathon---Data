United Way British Columbia (UWBC) supports the development of healthy, caring, and inclusive communities by strengthening vital connections that support people in need. The areas they are focusing on are Urgent Response, Children &amp; Youth, Seniors, Poverty, Mental Health, and Food Security.

## United Way Period Promise

- Periods are a fact of life.
- But accessing menstrual products can be difficult, especially for indigenous peoples, people living with disabilities, and people making less that $40,000/year.
- Period Promise is all about making accessing menstrual products easier than ever.


### Here's what we learned - Period poverty is common

- Approximately 51% of respondents to our public survey indicated that they had struggled to purchase product for themselves.
- 26% of respondents indicated that they had gone through a period without having menstrual products available to them.
- 13% of respondents indicated that, as dependents, their families had not been able to afford menstrual products on their behalf.


### Here's what we're doing

1. Collection drives to get product to agencies that serve vulnerable populations around the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley.
2. Working with unions, businesses, and government bodies of all sorts to change policy with our Policy Agreement.
3. Conducting research on period poverty in BC so that we can build effective and inclusive solutions.
4. Creating a toolkit for municipalities and businesses that want to run free menstrual product programming.


### Current Gaps

- **BC is geographically complex** - distribution cannot follow a consistent approach across regions.
- **Supply vs Demand** - replying on product donations means we don't always have a choice in what we collect, and we often run out of physical donations to distribute.
- **Certain demographics are disproportionately affected by period poverty** - how do we make equitable distribution decisions?
- **Charitable Model** - How do we empower systemic change rather than a reliance on donors to meet the needs of people in our community?


### Goals

- Become _more efficient_ with our product collection and distribution.
- Make more _financially conscious and equitable decisions_ with our product distribution.
- Create more _sustainable campaign models_ , both in terms of staff capacity and environmental sustainability.


### Deliverables

- Deliver new insights on the Period Promise Campaign, with a focus on modelling/other pattern analysis fir the demand and/or supply for period products in different regions by the campaign.
- Provide recommendations for how to standardize our data storage and processing practices to enable easier analysis.
- Visualize/represent insights for business use, considering bringing in census data to enrich our own or looking into how different demographics throughout the province are served.
